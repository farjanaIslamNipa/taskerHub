        <h3 class="fw-bold text-brand text-center">HiTasks Insurance Coverage </h3>
        <div class="pt-4">
          <h5 class="fw-bold">What is covered?</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>HiTasks Insurance is a third party liability policy covering up to $10 million AUD (to the equivalent value of $10 million AUD in your local currency) that insures Taskers registered in the HiTasks marketplace for their liability to third parties for personal injury or property damage whilst performing <span class="fw-bold text-brand">activities (not otherwise excluded)</span> during a task on HiTasks. For any tasks to have the benefit of this Insurance Policy they must have been booked, assigned and completed on the HiTasks marketplace.</li>
            <li>HiTasks Insurance does not cover all tasks or activities. Please refer to the list of <span class="fw-bold text-brand">excluded activities</span> for more information.</li>
            <li>The liability insurance is on a claims made and notified basis which means that the policy limit, terms and conditions which are applicable to a notified claim are those of the current policy period when the claim is notified – not when the claim occurs (if outside the current policy period). These may also be different from the liability insurance terms and conditions in place when the task contract was entered into if it also was in a different policy period. Claims must be lodged within 30 calendar days of the date of the incident.</li>
            <li>All coverage is subject to the policy’s terms and conditions and there are exclusions that apply.</li>
          </ul>
  
          <h5 class="fw-bold">What isn’t covered?</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>Some types of tasks or activities are not covered under the policy. Please refer to the list of <span class="fw-bold text-brand">excluded activities</span> for details on which activities are excluded.</li>
            <li>Individuals not registered on HiTasks are not covered under the insurance policy. Please ensure the person that completes the task for you is registered on HiTasks and is the person that your task is assigned to.</li>
            <li>Tasks must be completed and paid via the HiTasks platform to be eligible for the coverage subject to insurance terms and conditions. Any tasks paid via alternative means (including cash in hand) will not be covered.</li>
            <li>The insurance will not provide any cover to claims resulting from any sub-contracting of tasks.</li>
            <li>The insurance only provides cover for a Tasker’s liability for property damage or injury arising from <span class="fw-bold text-brand">activities (not otherwise excluded)</span> and does not cover faulty workmanship. Job Posters should enquire with the Tasker about their workmanship standards and any insurance for it prior to accepting an offer.</li>
            <li>Criminal activities, malicious or intentional damage is not covered by the policy. If this occurs, please report this to the police and HiTasks Support as soon as possible.</li>
            <li>The policy does not cover personal injury to, or damage to property belonging to the Tasker, and should not be considered a replacement for workers compensation, salary protection or other similar types of insurance.</li>
